One-line summary: Load netcdf module on yellowstone

The netcdf module is needed to build some of the csm_share stuff needed by the
mapping routines, for the upcoming drv unit tests.

Note that I have not done this for other machines: only for yellowstone.

        - Bump ifort version on yellowstone to 14.0.2.
        - Add option to have FC override the compiler command in
          config_compilers.
        - Add option for OpenMP (options are read from config_compilers).
        - Build directory is no longer a required option; if omitted, tests
          will be built in the current working directory.

One-line summary: Python refactoring and environment changes.

A       python/environment.py
A       python/test_environment.py
        - New classes for dealing with modules.
        - "expand_env" function
        - SoftEnvInterface is present, but still not ready for use.

M       python/machine_setup.py
        - Start refactoring to shift toward a more object oriented
          approach.
        - Add yellowstone/PGI module.
        - Start moving toward MPI support.

M       python/printer.py
        - Change CMakePrinter name to ScriptPrinter, add very basic
          indentation hook.

M       python/xml_test_list.py
        - Correct docstring grammar.

M       python/xml_utils.py
M       python/test_xml_utils.py
        - Add ability to ignore attributes.
        - Add "elements_to_dict" dictionary translation function.
        - These are not currently used, but were added in anticipation of
          environment xml file changes.

M       run_tests.py
        - Changes needed due to interface changes in other modules.
        - "-R" option replaced with "-T", which is a generic way to add
          arguments to CTest.
        - Add --use-mpi option (only changes compiler command determined
          from Machines currently).
        - Change Machines directory detection. Machines is now considered
          optional if not using a CESM build type, but is mandatory
          otherwise.
        - Fix bug where environment was not loaded correctly when
          rebuilding without "--clean" on yellowstone.
        - Remove CESM_Macros.CMake when cleaning a build.
        - Fail when make fails, instead of passing "-k" and ignoring the
          error code. This is too dangerous; the ability to keep going can
          be reimplemented when we have a more nuanced way to detect and
          alert the user to build errors.

         - In this version, all tests are ultimately CTest tests.

M       README
         - Update documentation with changes, reduce documentation that's
           redundant with the explanations in the module files themselves.

M       run_tests.py
         - Improve autodetection.
         - Allow CESM root directory to be specified, and use it for
           autodetection of other paths (including genf90.pl now).
         - Increase verbosity of CTest when "-v" option is given.

        - pFUnit and genf90 functions each get a new module.
        - Sourcelist_utils provides functions to help manage source files
          based on directory (i.e. to build as if using a Makefile VPATH).

A       python/comparable.py
M       python/xml_utils.py
M       python/test_xml_utils.py
        - Add workarounds to keep things working on both Python 2.6 and

        - Most of these workarounds are *not* necessary in Python 2.7,
          because.

A       python/printer.py
        - Fix bug that prevented error messages from being printed.

A       python/xml_test_list.py
A       python/test_xml_test_list.py
        - Add parser for an XML test list and tests for that module.

M       run_tests.py
        - Add XML test list functionality.
        - Build directory is now specified with a named option
          ("--build-dir"), so there are no naked arguments left.
        - Put some sections of run_tests.py into functions so that it's
          easier to loop over them (for test lists).

M       README
        - Document above changes.

          docstrings, and having modules define __all__.

          implementation.

D       cmake/CMakeMacros.pl

        - "--test-spec-dir" is now an option; test specification directory
          is no longer a mandatory option (to allow test lists later).

A       ChangeLog
        - Start this log.

M       cmake/CMakeMacros.pl
        - Fix bug. Note that this isn't being used right now, and may go
          away anyway, so the fix is really just in case there's a need to
          resuscitate this in the future.

M       cmake/CESM_utils.cmake
M       cmake/Compilers.cmake
        - Remove config_compilers related logic, as this is now handled in
          the python scripts.

M       test_xml_utils.py
M       xml_utils.py
        - Rename "xmltree" to "xml_tree" and "node" to "element".
        - Add all_matches function to xml parsing, and tests for it.

M       printer.py
        - Add CMakePrinter, and add "comment" method to Printer base class.

M       machine_setup.py
        - Add module loads for yellowstone.
        - Do all XML parsing of config_compilers here.

M       run_tests.py
        - Changes for machine_setup interface, and changing option to show
          that this script only depends on Machines.
