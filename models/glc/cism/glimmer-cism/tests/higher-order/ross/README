Ross Ice Shelf Experiment
=========================
This experiment was designed to model the Ross Ice Shelf off Antarctica.  
For information about the experiment and its results see:
http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html

The python scripts provided here (runRoss.py and plotRoss.py, refered to
in the following as the Ross scripts) were created to run the experiment 
using CISM and compare the results with measured velocities.

PREREQUISITES:
In order to use the Ross scripts, you will need to have Python and one of the
following Python modules installed:
Scientific.IO.NetCDF, netCDF4, or pycdf

To plot the results (which is the usual way to view the output), the Python 
matplotlib library also must be installed.

RUNNING THE EXPERIMENT:
Running the experiment is a two step process.  Each step invokes a python script
by entering a command on the command line.  The working directory should be the
directory which contains the Ross scripts.  This directory should also 
contain two subdirectories, "data", containing input data for the experiment, 
and "output", where the results of running the scripts will be written.


STEP 1. Run CISM by invoking the runRoss.py script:

python runRoss.py

Currently, the default settings are for this command to simply build the necessary
input files in the "./output" subdirectory. 

For details of how to use the script to also run CISM, see:

python runRoss.py --help

When CISM is run, it will be use model setting specified in ross.config (by default).


STEP 2. Plot the results by invoking the plotRoss.py script:

python plotRoss.py

The plotRoss.py script can also be invoked using command line options to plot
filled contours, change the color map, and mask the grounded region.  Example:

python plotRoss.py --ncontours=14 --vmax=1400 --cmap=gist_ncar --mask

Short forms of the options are also available.  Example:

python plotRoss.py -n 14 -v 1400 -c gist_ncar -m

# Output files

OUTPUT FILES:
When you run runRoss.py, it creates three NetCDF files in the "output"
subdirectory.  These files can be examined using a tool such as ncview. Their
contents are described below.

1. raw.nc is netCDF file containing the experiment input data from the "data" 
directory with minimal modification.  This file is really not necessary.
2. ross.nc is an input file created by runRoss.py which provides input 
information to CISM.
3. ross.out.nc is an output file created by CISM.
